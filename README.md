# Simon Game

Basic Simon Game that keeps track of current input sequence and randomly generated sequence. Integrates user interaction.

## Features

This is a Simon game, where the player has to follow the sequence of colors generated by the computer. The game starts when the player either presses a key or clicks the start button. The computer generates a random color sequence and plays it for the player. The player then has to repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. If the player gets the sequence correct, the computer generates a longer sequence in the next level. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and the player can restart by pressing any key or clicking the start button. The score is based on the number of levels completed.
